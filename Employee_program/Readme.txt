These are the files for the program we will need to eventually make

-ABSTRACT: We need to create a GUI, we must determine what other employee information is useful.
We must be able to archive an employee (to save for later use), the ability to hide certain aspects
of employee data from users. Have the ability to add new employees with admin access.

Direct quote: "For this project you will start with the Employee Class project that you completed in CS1410. 
This project will serve as a beginning of your prototype that you will develop further 
to solve some of the major features that the Employee class did not address... such as a 
simplified and effect user interface using a GUI, more data that is required as part of a 
useful employee record, the ability to archive a employee that is no longer of concern 
the ability to edit the employee's data, the ability to hide certain aspects of the employee's
data from those that should not be able to view that data, and the ability to add new employees.
The owner expects the project to be managed in an agile principled fashion and to use object
 oriented methodologies that are loosely coupled and highly cohesive."

Design: We will need to make certain buttons only appear if a user is a certain rol (admin, employee)
admin roles will have access to all buttons and windows, while we can make it appear conditionally.
We will need to figure this out either before or after we design our GUI, we can decide together.
